Here I will be posting my programs that I have designed in Java as answers to Stanfords CS106a. 
Not every answer to every problem will be here and there is no guarantee of these programs being the only
or best way to solve the problems, but rather the way I have come up with, and are being put on GitHub for
the sole purpose of gaining experience with Git and GitHub.
