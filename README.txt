These Programs are in response to Stanford's class CS106a.
Not every answer to every problem will be here and there is no guarantee of these programs being the only
or best way to solve the problems, but rather the way I have come up with, and are being put on GitHub mainly
to gain experience with Git, GitHub and practicing Java Program Writing during my effort to learn
to code. Enjoy and I would love any feedback.

As of now you can find the questions/ problems here: http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/
However, there is no guarantee this website will stay up and running.
